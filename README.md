# POM
Populations of models for cardiac electrophysiology

Use the MATLAB function generatePoM() to create a population of cardiac electrophysiology models (POM) using either the ORd or the TP06 model. The POM can then be calibrated to some experimental data by using the calibratePoM() function. Details on using the generation and calibration functions, as well as how to save the data, can be found in the functions' documentation. To understand what are POM and experimentally-calibrated POM, please read the paper cited at the end of this file.

Three sample activation-recovery interval data are provided in the ARIdata folder. These data have been acquired as explained in the paper mentioned at the end of this file. Any use of these data and functions must cite that paper; check this repository regularly, as more papers, which must also be cited, are being prepared.

More population-based analyses to come....
